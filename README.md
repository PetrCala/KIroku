## Alcohol tracker

Track your everyday alcohol adventures using a natively ran application.

### How to run

#### Obtaining the application file directly

The application is obtainable per request from the developers in the form of an `.apk` file for Android devices, or an `IPA` file for iOS. Using this file, you can easily install the application by double tapping said file on your device. Make sure to enable installation from external sources on request.

#### Downloading the application file from Play Store or iOS Store

Once the application will reach version 1.0.0 (i.e. it will became fully functional), we intend to place it on both of the popular markets, where it will be easily accessible.
