# Overview

No matter your current knowledge set, you are always welcome to the Kiroku developer team. To get working on the project, however, there are a number of concepts/technologies you should get to know first. Some of them are mandatory, while others are good to know. Given the large number of new concepts this may present for you, we recommend you start going through them in the order they are listed.
